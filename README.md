# Plant 'em and Go

## **A mobile app that encourages users to get outside, explore nature, and increase their physical activity!**

Users gain reward points by ***scanning plants***, which also indexes the scanned plant in their own personal ***plant compendium***. By scanning a plant, the user reveals additional information about the plant to teach them more about the natural world they are surrounded by. Additionally, the app tracks the steps a user has taken throughout the day. More steps means a greater score ***multiplier*** when scanning a plant!

Plant 'em and Go also features a ***community leaderboard***! Registered users are ranked based on their scores, allowing for some friendly competition.
