# Plant 'em and Go

## **A mobile app that encourages users to get outside, explore nature, and increase their physical activity!**

Users gain reward points by ***scanning plants***, which also indexes the scanned plant in their own personal ***plant compendium***. By scanning a plant, the user reveals additional information about the plant to teach them more about the natural world they are surrounded by. Some plants are worth more than others, however, so be on the lookout for elusive plants. Additionally, the app tracks the steps a user has taken throughout the day. More steps means a greater score ***multiplier*** when scanning a plant!

Plant 'em and Go also features a ***community leaderboard***! Registered users are ranked based on their point scores, allowing for some friendly competition.
